                  Before using this software, please read the
                                     NOTICE

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
   accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting
   CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API
   for mmCIF files. Starting with this release, CBFLIB performs validation
   checks on reading of a CBF. If a dictionary is provided, values will be
   validated against dictionary ranges and enumerations. Tags missing under
   parent-child relationships or category key requirements will be reported.
   CBFlib provides functions to create, read, modify and write CBF binary
   data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

  Installation

   CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 350 megabytes of free
   space. CBFlib_0.7.8.tar.gz is a "gzipped" tar of the code as it now
   stands. In addition, CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar.gz is a "gzipped tar of
   the data files needed to test the API. Place both gzipped tars in the
   directory that is intended to contain two new directories, named
   CBFlib_0.7.8 (the "top-level" directory) and CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.
   Uncompress both tarballs with gunzip and unpack them with tar:

      gunzip CBFlib_0.7.8.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.7.8.tar
      gunzip CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar

   As with prior releases, to run the test programs, you will also need Paul
   Ellis's sample MAR345 image, example.mar2300, and Chris Nielsen's sample
   ADSC Quantum 315 image, mb_LP_1_001.img as sample data. In addition there
   are not various insulin_pilatus6m sample data files from E. Eikenberry at
   SLS. All these files will be extracted by the Makefile from
   CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files. Do not download copies into the top level
   directory.

   After unpacking the archives, the top-level directory should contain a
   makefile:

                           Makefile   Makefile for unix 

   and the subdirectories:

     src/           CBFLIB source files                                       
     include/       CBFLIB header files                                       
     m4/            CBFLIB m4 macro files (used to build .f90 files)          
     examples/      Example program source files                              
     doc/           Documentation                                             
     lib/           Compiled CBFLIB (libcbf.a) and FCBLIB (libfcb.a)          
                  libraries                                                   
     bin/           Executable example programs                               
     html_images/   JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files              

   and additional Makefiles for other systems. All the makefiles are created
   from m4/Makefile.m4. The current set of Makefiles are Makefile_LINUX,
   Makefile_LINUX_gcc42, Makefile_OSX, Makefile_OSX_gcc42, Makefile_AIX and
   Makefile_MINGW. Edit the closest approximation to your system, and then
   copy that variant to Makefile. For instructions on compiling and testing
   the library, go to the top-level directory and type:

      make

   Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed information.
