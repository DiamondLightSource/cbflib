An initial set of Java wrapper classes for CBFlib-0.8.0 has been implemented using SWIG. A pair
of example programs (testcbf.c and testcbf.java) are included that show the similarities and
differences of using CBFlib in C and Java.

This has been tested using Red Hat EL 4.7 WS for i568 and Red Hat EL 5.3 WS for x86_64 with Sun's JDK.

In addition to the static methods in org.iucr.cbflib.cbf, four helper classes are included. These are
wrapper classes for C pointers that point to size_t (sizetp), int (intp), unsigned int (uintp) and
double (doublep). Also, some helper functions for a pointer to pointer to char (charpp_*) aid the
output of strings. Finally, a constructor and a destructor has been added to the cbf_handle_struct class.
