                              The IUCr Policy
                                     on
           the Use of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF)
                                      
   The Crystallographic Information File (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is,
   as of January 1992, the recommended method for submitting publications
   to Acta Crystallographica Section C. The International Union of
   Crystallography holds the Copyright on the CIF, and has applied for
   Patents on the STAR File syntax which is the basis for the CIF format.
   
   It is a principal objective of the IUCr to promote the use of CIF for
   the exchange and storage of scientific data. The IUCr's sponsorship of
   the CIF development was motivated by its responsibility to its
   scientific journals, which set the standards in crystallographic
   publishing. The IUCr intends that CIFs will be used increasingly for
   electronic submission of manuscripts to these journals in future. The
   IUCr recognises that, if the CIF and the STAR File are to be adopted
   as a means for universal data exchange, the syntax of these files must
   be strictly and uniformly adhered to. Even small deviations from the
   syntax would ultimately cause the demise of the universal file
   concept. Through its Copyrights and Patents the IUCr has taken the
   steps needed to ensure strict conformance with this syntax.
   
   The IUCr policy on the use of the CIF and STAR File processes is as
   follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
    1. CIFs and STAR Files may be generated, stored or transmitted,
       without permission or charge, provided their purpose is not
       specifically for profit or commercial gain, and provided that the
       published syntax is strictly adhered to.
    2. Computer software may be developed for use with CIFs or STAR
       files, without permission or charge, provided it is distributed in
       the public domain. This condition also applies to software for
       which a charge is made, provided that its primary function is for
       use with files that satisfy condition 1 and that it is distributed
       as a minor component of a larger package of software.
    3. Permission will be granted for the use of CIFs and STAR Files for
       specific commercial purposes (such as databases or network
       exchange processes), and for the distribution of commercial
       CIF/STAR software, on written application to the IUCr Executive
       Secretary, 2 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England. The nature,
       terms and duration of the licences granted will be determined by
       the IUCr Executive and Finance Committees.
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   In summary, the IUCr wishes to promote the use of the STAR File
   concepts as a standard universal data file. It will insist on strict
   compliance with the published syntax for all applications. To assist
   with this compliance, the IUCr provides public domain software for
   checking the logical integrity of a CIF, and for validating the data
   name definitions contained within a CIF. Detailed information on this
   software, and the associated dictionaries, may be obtained from the
   IUCr Office at 5 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England.

   The following Notice applies to the file cbf_PARSER.simple, from which
   is included with this library.
     * cbf_PARSER.simple is made from the output of a bison run against a
       grammar by Herbert J. Bernstein, yaya@bernstein-plus-sons.com on
       10 August 1998.
       
     * This file is used as a replacement for /usr/lib/bison.simple if it
       is necessary to rebuild cbf.stx.tab.c
       
     * Under the terms of the "special exception", below, we may use the
       file from which this file was made "without restriction". We have
       made only one signficant change to the original file changing the
       __GNUC__ declaration of yyparse to be
       
       #ifdef YYPARSE_PARAM
       int yyparse (void *YYPARSE_PARAM);
       #else
       int yyparse (void);
       #endif
       
       and suppressed the "#line" declarations.
       
     * Please treat this file as being subject to the same conditions as
       the original bison.simple. However, inclusion of this file with
       other software purely for the purpose of providing a replacement
       for bison.simple does not bring that other software within the
       reach of the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the file
       COPYING.PARSER for the GNU GPL. In particular, CBFlib is not
       covered by the GNU GPL.
