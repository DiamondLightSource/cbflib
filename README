     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Before using this software, please read the
                                     NOTICE
for important disclaimers and the IUCr Policy on the Use of the Crystallographic
            Information File (CIF) and other important information.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
   accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting
   CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API
   for mmCIF files. Like CIFPARSE, CBFLIB does not perform any semantic
   integrity checks and simply provides functions to create, read, modify and
   write CBF binary data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

  Installation

   CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 200 megabytes of free
   space. CBFlib.tar.gz is a "gzipped" tar of the code as it now stands.
   Place the gzipped tar in the directory that is intended to contain a new
   directory, named CBFlib_0.7.5 (the "top-level" directory) and uncompress
   it with gunzip and unpack it with tar:

      gunzip CBFlib.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB.tar

   To run the test programs, you will also need to put Paul Ellis's sample
   MAR345 image, example.mar2300, and Chris Nielsen's sample ADSC Quantum 315
   image, mb_LP_1_001.img as sample data. in the directory containing the
   top-level directory. (The image can also be found at After unpacking the
   archive, the top-level directory should contain a makefile:

                           Makefile   Makefile for unix 

   and the subdirectories:

           src/           CBFLIB source files                          
           include/       CBFLIB header files                          
           examples/      Example program source files                 
           doc/           Documentation                                
           lib/           Compiled CBFLIB library                      
           bin/           Executable example programs                  
           html_images/   JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files 

   For instructions on compiling and testing the library, go to the top-level
   directory and type:

      make

   Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed information.
