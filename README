   CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism
   for accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and
   Image-supporting CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on
   the CIFPARSE API for mmCIF files. Starting with this release, CBFLIB
   performs validation checks on reading of a CBF. If a dictionary is
   provided, values will be validated against dictionary ranges and
   enumerations. Tags missing under parent-child relationships or category
   key requirements will be reported. CBFlib provides functions to create,
   read, modify and write CBF binary data files and imgCIF ASCII data
   files.

  Installation

   CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 250 megabytes of free
   space. CBFlib_0.7.8.tar.gz is a "gzipped" tar of the code as it now
   stands. In addition, CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar.gz is a "gzipped tar
   of the data files needed to test the API. Place both gzipped tars in
   the directory that is intended to contain two new directories, named
   CBFlib_0.7.8 (the "top-level" directory) and CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.
   Uncompress both tarballs with gunzip and unpack them with tar:

      gunzip CBFlib_0.7.8.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.7.8.tar
      gunzip CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.7.8_Data_Files.tar

   As with prior releases, to run the test programs, you will also need
   Paul Ellis's sample MAR345 image, example.mar2300, and Chris Nielsen's
   sample ADSC Quantum 315 image, mb_LP_1_001.img as sample data. In
   addition there are not various insulin_pilatus6m sample data files from
   E. Eikenberry at SLS. All these files will be extracted by the Makefile
   from CBFlib_0.7.8_Data_Files. Do not download copies into the top level
   directory.

   After unpacking the archives, the top-level directory should contain a
   makefile:

                           Makefile   Makefile for unix 

   and the subdirectories:

         src/                          CBFLIB source files
       include/                        CBFLIB header files
         m4/             CBFLIB m4 macro files (used to build .f90 files)
      examples/                    Example program source files
         doc/                             Documentation
         lib/       Compiled CBFLIB (libcbf.a) and FCBLIB (libfcb.a) libraries
         bin/                      Executable example programs
     html_images/          JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files

   For instructions on compiling and testing the library, go to the
   top-level directory and type:

      make

   Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed
   information.
